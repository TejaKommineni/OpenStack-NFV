# OpenStack-NFV

This Project is aimed at doing Software Defined Networking(SDN) in a cloud environment.

We use the OpenStack cloud computing platform in the CloudLab to achieve this goal. 

Using the OpenStack environment together with the Quagga open source routing suite
we implement network functions virtualization (NFV). We realize a simple NFV-enabled 
routed network and develop a basic OSPF NFV orchestrator to perform dynamic, 
zero-impact, network modifications.
